# DW-project

The main data set I use is too large (170M) to upload to github, Please refer to the kaggle link if necessary:
https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events?select=ginf.csv

'dictionary.txt' and 'ginf.csv' are other two data sets I used in this project.

'export-data-score.csv' is a data frame I save in the project.

'presentation slides-soccer' is the presentation material.

'project- The Beauty of Soccer' has two versions, html and pdf. They are the same.

'r-code-soccer.Rmd' is the code.
